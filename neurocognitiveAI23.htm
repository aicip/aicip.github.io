  <hr/>

  <p>The fields of cognitive neuroscience and AI have a long and intertwined history. Many of the early pioneers straddled both fields. However, this strong interaction has become less common as both fields have grown enormously in complexity and disciplinary boundaries have solidified. With the advent of new experimental and analysis techniques and with the emergence of large international research initiatives, alongside recent advances in computer architectures, the resurgence of interest in cognitive neuroscience as a rich source for revolutionizing foundational AI studies has led to an exciting new synergy between the two fields. The workshop provides a venue that largely facilitates collaboration of researchers from both communities, with a strong emphasis on learning dynamics and its neural foundations, a cornerstone of human intelligence. </p>
